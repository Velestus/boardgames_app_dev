# Board Games Collection

Website containing information regarding mine board game collection. _Here are stored my development files._

## This project can be accessed [here] to view.

Routing here uses hashes, to allow single page navigation on mine hosting (so it won't send any requests to the server regarding non-existing paths).

This project is functionally completed. I wasn't able to make good pictures of every single board game to put them here, but it will be added eventually. It doesn't influence application's workflow.

Site is written in Polish, as this is my native language. I am planning to create files with translations and load them regarding to locale (with English as default).

To-do list:
- [x] Add every owned board game into database.
- [x] Use json to hold all data regarding board games.
- [x] Consistent styling of the website.
- [x] Tested display on different devices and web browsers.
- [x] RWD.
- [x] Add my upgrades to board games.
- [x] Add routing.
- [x] Place website on hosting server.
- [x] Troubleshooting after migration to hosting server.
- [ ] Add some events into database.
- [ ] Different languages.
- [ ] All photos added.
- [ ] Lazy loading of images.
- [ ] Performance upgrades.

Whole website is written with usage of Angular 5 as JS framework and Bootstrap for CSS.

Enjoy browsing!
